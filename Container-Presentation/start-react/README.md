# Container-Presentation

<span>In this pattern, we can divide our component into two smaller parts, separating their responsibilities.</span>

## Container
<ul>
   <li> Deal with the logic and behavior of the application </li>
   <li> Make API calls and manipulate your data </li>
   <li> Define event handlers </li>
   <li> Are written as classes </li>
   <li> Render presentation components </li>
</ul>  

## Presentation
<ul>
   <li> Deal with the look of the app </li>
   <li> Receive data from proprietary components/containers as props </li>
   <li> Are written as stateless functional components </li>
   <li> Render HTML and/or other components </li>
</ul>
